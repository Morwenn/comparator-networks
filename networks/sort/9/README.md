## Sorting network, size 9

### Size-optimal network

The following size-optimal network of size 9 is described in Donald E. Knuth's *The Art of Computer Programming, Vol.
3*, and has the interesting property that it also contains an optimal merging network for three series of three sorted
elements.

This size-optimal network of size 9 has been found with an approach called Symmetry and Evolution based Network Sort
Optimization (SENSO), with is described in [*Using Symmetry and Evolutionary Search to Minimize Sorting Networks*][1] by
Vinod K. Valsalam and Risto Miikkulainen.
